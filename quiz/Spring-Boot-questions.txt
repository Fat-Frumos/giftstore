What is Spring vs Spring Boot?	Spring is a framework for building Java applications while Spring Boot is built on top of the Spring framework and provides additional features and capabilities to accelerate application development. With Spring Boot, you can focus more on business features and less on infrastructure.
Discuss the advantages of using Spring Boot.	Some advantages of using Spring Boot include its ability to create stand-alone Spring applications, embed Tomcat, Jetty or Undertow directly (no need to deploy WAR files), provide opinionated 'starter' dependencies to simplify your build configuration, automatically configure Spring and 3rd party libraries whenever possible, and provide production-ready features such as metrics, health checks, and externalized configuration.
How does Spring Boot work?	Spring Boot looks at your classpath and at the beans you have configured, makes reasonable assumptions about what you are missing, and adds those items. It does not generate code or make edits to your files. Instead, when you start your application, Spring Boot dynamically wires up beans and settings and applies them to your application context.
How do you set up a Spring Boot project?	You can set up a Spring Boot project by visiting the Spring Initializr website, filling in your project details, picking your options, and downloading a bundled up project as a zip file. You can also import the code straight into your IDE.
What is autoconfiguration?	Autoconfiguration is a feature of Spring Boot that automatically configures your application based on the dependencies that it declares.
How do you disable autoconfiguration ?	You can disable specific auto-configuration classes by using the exclude attribute of the @EnableAutoConfiguration annotation or by using the spring.autoconfigure.exclude property.
What is the process of registering a custom autoconfiguration with Spring Boot?	To register a custom autoconfiguration with Spring Boot, you need to create a class annotated with @Configuration that contains bean definitions for the components that you want to autoconfigure. Then you need to create a file named spring.factories in the META-INF directory of your project and list your configuration class under the org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.EnableAutoConfiguration key.
Can you list the available Spring Boot starters?	Spring Boot provides several starter dependencies such as spring-boot-starter-web for building web applications with Spring MVC, spring-boot-starter-data-jpa for accessing data with JPA, spring-boot-starter-security for adding security features to your application, among others.
What are starter dependencies?	Starter dependencies are pre-configured sets of dependencies provided by Spring Boot that simplify your build configuration. They include everything you need to get started with a specific type of project.
What are the most important skills for a Spring Boot programmer to have?	Some important skills for a Spring Boot programmer to have include knowledge of the Java language and the Spring framework, understanding of software design principles and patterns, experience with build tools such as Maven or Gradle, familiarity with databases and data access technologies, among others.

What is Spring Boot CLI and what are its benefits?	Spring Boot CLI is a command line tool that allows you to run and test Spring Boot applications from the command line. It provides a fast and convenient way to bootstrap and run Spring Boot applications, and can be especially useful for scripting and automation tasks.
What are the Spring Boot key components?	Spring Boot's key components include its autoconfiguration feature, which automatically configures your application based on the dependencies that it declares; its starter dependencies, which are pre-configured sets of dependencies that simplify your build configuration; and its embedded servlet container support, which allows you to run your application as a stand-alone executable JAR file.
What does the @ SpringBoot Application annotation do internally?	The @SpringBootApplication annotation is a convenience annotation that combines several other annotations. It enables autoconfiguration by including the @EnableAutoConfiguration annotation, it enables component scanning by including the @ComponentScan annotation, and it enables configuration by including the @Configuration annotation.
What is the purpose of using @ Component Scan in the class files?	The purpose of using @ComponentScan in class files is to enable component scanning, which allows Spring to automatically discover and register beans in the application context. This can simplify your configuration by allowing you to declare your beans with annotations such as @Component, @Service, or @Repository instead of explicitly defining them in a configuration class.
What are the most common Spring Boot CLI commands?	Some common Spring Boot CLI commands include `run`, which runs a Spring Boot application; `test`, which runs tests for a Spring Boot application; `jar`, which creates an executable JAR file for a Spring Boot application; and `install`, which installs dependencies for a Spring Boot application.
What are the basic annotations that Spring Boot offers?	Spring Boot offers several basic annotations such as @SpringBootApplication, which combines several other annotations to enable autoconfiguration, component scanning, and configuration; @EnableAutoConfiguration, which enables autoconfiguration; @ComponentScan, which enables component scanning; and @Configuration, which indicates that a class declares one or more bean methods.
What is Spring Boot dependency management?	Spring Boot dependency management refers to the way that Spring Boot manages dependencies for your application. It provides a curated list of compatible versions for commonly used dependencies and automatically manages their versions for you. This can help you avoid conflicts and ensure that your application uses compatible versions of its dependencies.

What is the default port of Tomcat ?	The default port of Tomcat is 8080.
Can you override or replace the embedded Tomcat service ?	Yes, you can override or replace the embedded Tomcat service . You can do this by excluding the `Tomcat` dependency and including a different servlet container dependency such as `Jetty` or `Undertow` in your build configuration.
Can you disable the default web server in the Spring Boot application?	Yes, you can disable the default web server by setting the `spring.main.web-application-type` property to `NONE` or by using the `setWebApplicationType(WebApplicationType.NONE)` method on your `SpringApplication` instance.
How do you disable a specific auto-configuration class?	You can disable a specific auto-configuration class by using the `exclude` attribute of the `@EnableAutoConfiguration` annotation or by using the `spring.autoconfigure.exclude` property.
Explain @ RestController annotation ?	The `@RestController` annotation is a convenience annotation that combines the `@Controller` and `@ResponseBody` annotations. It indicates that the annotated class is a controller where every method returns a domain object instead of a view.
What is the difference between @ RestControll and @ Controller ?	The main difference between `@RestController` and `@Controller` is that `@RestController` combines `@Controller` and `@ResponseBody`, meaning that every method returns a domain object instead of a view. With `@Controller`, you need to explicitly use the `@ResponseBody` annotation on each method that returns a domain object.
Describe the flow of HTTPS requests through the Spring Boot application?	When an HTTPS request is received by a Spring Boot application, it is first handled by the embedded servlet container (such as Tomcat). The request is then passed through any configured filters before being dispatched to an appropriate controller method. The controller method processes the request and returns a response, which is then sent back to the client through any configured filters and the servlet container.
What is the difference between RequestMapping and GetMapping?	`@RequestMapping` is a general-purpose annotation that can be used to map HTTP requests to handler methods. It can be used with any HTTP method by specifying the `method` attribute. `@GetMapping`, on the other hand, is a shorthand annotation for mapping HTTP GET requests specifically. It is equivalent to using `@RequestMapping(method = RequestMethod.GET)`.
What is the use of Profiles ?	Profiles allow you to define and activate different sets of configurations and beans for different environments or contexts. you can define different profiles for development, testing, and production environments, and activate the appropriate profile for each environment when starting your application.
