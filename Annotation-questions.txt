What is the purpose of the @SpringBootApplication annotation in Spring Boot?	 used to mark the main class of a Spring Boot application. It combines several annotations, including @Configuration, @EnableAutoConfiguration, and @ComponentScan, providing a convenient way to bootstrap a Spring application.
Explain the difference between @Component, @Service, and @Repository annotations in Spring Boot	are used for component scanning and auto-detection in Spring Boot. @Component is a generic annotation for any Spring-managed component, @Service is used to annotate service layer components, and @Repository is used for DAO (Data Access Object) components.
What is the purpose of the @Value annotation in Spring Boot? How is it used? 	is used to inject values from properties files or configuration files into Spring Boot beans. It allows you to access properties or configuration values directly in your code by providing the key of the property or configuration.
What is the purpose of the @EnableAutoConfiguration annotation in Spring Boot?	is used to enable Spring Boot's auto-configuration feature. It automatically configures beans and dependencies based on the classpath, reducing the need for explicit configuration.
What is the purpose of the @Async annotation in Spring Boot? How is it used?	is used to mark a method as asynchronous in Spring Boot. It allows the method to be executed asynchronously, meaning it can run in a separate thread, improving performance and responsiveness of the application.
What is the purpose of the @SpringBootTest annotation in Spring Boot testing?	is used to bootstrap the application context for integration tests in Spring Boot. It loads the complete Spring application context, including all beans and configurations, allowing you to perform integration tests on the application.
What is the purpose of the @EnableJpaRepositories annotation in Spring Boot?	 is used to enable JPA repository support in Spring Boot. It scans for Spring Data JPA repositories and automatically creates the necessary implementation based on defined interfaces.
What is the purpose of the @RestControllerAdvice annotation in Spring Boot?	is used to define global exception handling and response customization for RESTful APIs in Spring Boot. It allows you to handle exceptions centrally and provide consistent error responses across the application.
What is the purpose of the @ConfigurationProperties annotation in Spring Boot?	is used to bind external configuration properties to Spring Boot beans. It simplifies the process of reading and validating properties from various sources, such as properties files or environment variables.
Explain the role of Spring Boot's @Conditional annotations and provide examples.	 are used to conditionally enable or disable bean creation or configuration based on specific conditions. Examples include @ConditionalOnProperty, @ConditionalOnClass, and @ConditionalOnExpression, which allow you to customize the application's behavior based on the environment or classpath conditions.
What is the purpose of the @EnableCaching annotation in Spring Boot?	 is used to enable caching capabilities in Spring Boot. It allows you to cache method results, improving performance by reducing the need to execute the same method multiple times.
What is the purpose of the @EnableTransactionManagement annotation in Spring Boot?	 is used to enable transaction management in Spring Boot. It allows you to annotate methods with @Transactional to define transactional boundaries, ensuring atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability of database operations.
